          <p>The morphology of Irish is in some respects typical of an Indo-European language. Nouns are declined for number and case, and verbs for person and number. Nouns are classified by masculine or feminine gender. Other aspects of Irish morphology, while typical for an Insular Celtic language, are not typical for Indo-European, such as the presence of inflected prepositions and the initial consonant mutations. Irish syntax is also rather different from that of most Indo-European languages, due to its use of the verb-subject-object word order.</p>

          <p>Word order in Irish is of the form VSO (verb-subject-object) so that, for example, "He hit me" is <em>Bhuail</em> [hit-past tense] <em>sé</em> [he] <em>mé</em> [me].</p> 
          <p>One distinctive aspect of Irish is the distinction between <em>is</em>, the copula (known in Irish as <em>an chopail</em>), and <em>tá</em>. <em>Is</em> describes identity or quality in a permanence sense, while temporary aspects are described by <em>tá</em>. This is similar to the difference between the verbs <em>ser</em> and <em>estar</em> in Spanish and Portuguese, although this is not an exact match; <em>is</em> and <em>tá</em> are cognate respectively with the Spanish <em>es</em> and <em>está.</em></p>
          Examples are:
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Is fear é.</em> "He is a man." (Spanish <em>Es un hombre</em>, Portuguese <em>(Ele) é um homem</em>)</li>
              <li><em>Is duine fuar é.</em> "He is cold (a cold-hearted person)." (Spanish <em>Es frío</em>, Portuguese <em>(Ele) é frio</em>)</li>
              <li><em>Tá sé/Tomás fuar.</em> "He/Thomas is cold" (= feels cold) (Alt. <em>Tá fuacht air</em> [= "Cold is on him"]). (Spanish <em>Tiene</em> - in this case Spanish uses <em>tener</em> (to have) instead of <em>estar</em> (to be), Portuguese <em>(Ele) está com frio</em>)</li>
              <li><em>Tá sé ina chodladh.</em> "He is asleep." (Spanish <em>Él está durmiendo</em>, Portuguese <em>Ele está a dormir</em>)</li>
              <li><em>Is duine maith é.</em> "He is good (a good person)." (Spanish <em>Es bueno</em>, Portuguese <em>(Ele) é bom</em>)</li>
              <li><em>Tá sé go maith.</em> "He is well." (Spanish <em>Está bien</em>, Portuguese <em>(Ele) está bem</em>)</li>
            </ul>

          <p>Irish is an inflected language, having four cases: <em>ainmneach</em> (nominative and accusative), <em>gairmeach</em> (vocative), <em>ginideach</em> (genitive) and <em>tabharthach</em> (prepositional). The prepositional case is called the dative by convention.</p>
          <p>Irish nouns are masculine or feminine. To a certain degree the gender difference is indicated by specific word endings, <em>-án</em> and <em>-ín</em> being masculine and <em>-óg</em> feminine. While the neuter has mostly disappeared from vocabulary, the neuter gender is seen in various place names in Ireland.</p>

          <p>The Irish definite article has two forms: <em>an</em> and <em>na</em>. <em>An</em> may cause lenition, eclipsis, or neither. <em>Na</em> may cause eclipsis, but the only instance of lenition with <em>na</em> is with the genitive singular of the word <em>céad</em> meaning first. <em>An</em> is used in the common case singular for all nouns, and lenites feminine nouns. In the genitive singular, <em>an</em> with lenition is used with masculine nouns, <em>na</em> with feminine nouns. In the dative singular, <em>an</em> may cause lenition or eclipsis depending on the preposition preceding it and on regional norms (in Ulster usage, lenition is standard with all prepositions, while in other regions eclipsis is used with many). <em>Na</em> is the only plural form of the article; it causes eclipsis in the genitive for both genders, and no mutation in other cases.</p>
          <p>Names of countries usually take the definite article in the nominative: <em>An Fhrainc</em> "France", <em>an Bhrasaíl</em> "Brazil", <em>an tSeapáin</em> "Japan". Exceptions to this include <em>Éire</em> "Ireland", <em>Albain</em> "Scotland" and <em>Sasana</em> "England".</p>
          <p>There is no indefinite article in Irish; the word appears by itself, for example: <em>Tá peann agam.</em> - "I have a pen", <em>Tá madra sa seomra.</em> - "There's a dog in the room".</p>
          <p>When two definite noun phrases appear as part of a genitive construction (equivalent to the X of the Y in English), only the noun phrase in the genitive takes the article. Compare <em>Áras an Uachtaráin</em> or <em>Teitheamh na nIarlaí</em> to English the residence of the President, the flight of the Earls.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Adjectives">
          <header>Adjectives</header>
          <p>Irish adjectives always follow the noun. The adjective is influenced by the case, number and gender of the noun preceding it.</p>
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li><em>An cailín beag</em> "The small girl" - masculine singular nominative</li>
              <li><em>An bhean bhocht</em> "The poor woman" - feminine singular nominative</li>
              <li><em>Na buachaillí óga</em> "The young boys" - masculine plural nominative</li>
            </ul>
          </code>
          <p>Adjectives in Irish have two morphological degrees of comparison: the positive (Irish: <em>bunchéim</em>), e.g. <em>Tá an buachaill cairdiúil</em> "the boy is friendly", and the comparative (<em>breischéim</em>), e.g. <em>Tá an cailín níos cairdiúla ná an buachaill</em> "the girl is nicer than the boy". A superlative (<em>sárchéim</em>) sense is rendered by the comparative in a relative clause, e.g. <em>Is é Seán an páiste is cairdiúla den triúr</em> "Seán is the nicest child of the three".</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Adverbs">
          <header>Adverbs</header>
          <p>Irish adverbs are used to modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.</p>
          <p>An adverb can be created from an adjective by adding go before it, e.g. <em>go mall</em>, <em>go tapaidh</em>, <em>go maith</em>, etc. If the adjective begins with a vowel, ⟨h⟩ is added before it, e.g. <em>go hálainn</em>, <em>go híseal</em>, <em>go háirithe</em>, etc.</p>
          <p>Adverbs can often be created from nouns by putting a preposition before them, e.g. <em>ar bith</em>, <em>de ghnáth</em>, <em>faoi dheireadh</em>, etc.</p>
          <p>Other categories of adverbs include the following:</p>
          <code>
            <ul>
            <li>Adverbs that describe relation to time, e.g. <em>uaireanta</em>, <em>anois</em>, <em>cheana</em>, etc.</li>
            <li>Adverbs that describe relation to place, e.g. <em>ann</em>, <em>abhaile</em>, <em>amuigh</em>, etc.</li>
            <li>Adverbs used in questions, e.g. <em>cathain?</em>, <em>conas?</em>, <em>cá?</em>, etc.</li>
            <li>Adverbs used for negation, e.g. <em>ní</em>, <em>nach</em>, <em>nár</em>, etc.</li>
            <li>Other adverbs, e.g. <em>áfach</em>, <em>chomh maith</em>, <em>ach oiread</em>, etc.</li>

          <p>There are two conjugations and 11 irregular verbs. Tenses or moods are formed by inflecting the stem, and in the past and habitual past tenses and the conditional mood also by leniting any initial consonant. The inflected tense and mood forms are: present indicative, present habitual indicative (differs from present only in the verb <em>bí</em> "to be"), future, past indicative, past habitual indicative, conditional, imperative, present subjunctive, and past subjunctive. Verbs also have a verbal noun and past participle, and progressive constructions similar to those using the English present participle may be formed from the verbal noun and an appropriate tense of <em>bí</em>.</p>
          <p>Examples of tense conjugations: (all third person forms without subject pronoun):</p>
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>1st conjugation: <em>Fág</em> "to leave" - <em>d'fhág</em> (past) - <em>fágann</em> (present) - <em>fágfaidh</em> (future) - <em>d'fhágfadh</em> (conditional) - <em>d'fhágadh</em> (habitual past) - <em>fága</em> (subjunctive) - <em>fágadh</em> (imperative)</li>
              <li>2nd conjugation: <em>Ceannaigh</em> "to buy" - <em>cheannaigh</em> (past) - <em>ceannaíonn</em> (present) - <em>ceannóidh</em> (future) - <em>cheannódh</em> (conditional) - <em>cheannaíodh</em> (habitual past) - <em>ceannaí</em> (subjunctive) - <em>ceannaíodh</em> (imperative)</li>
              <li>Irregular: <em>Téigh</em> "to go" - <em>chuaigh</em> (past) - <em>téann</em> (present) - <em>rachaidh</em> (future) - <em>rachadh</em> (conditional) - <em>théadh</em> (habitual past) - <em>té</em> (subjunctive) - <em>téadh</em> (imperative)</li>
            </ul>
          </code>
          <p>In addition to the passive voice, there is the impersonal form of the verb, termed the <em>saorbhriathar</em> or "autonomous verb", which serves a similar function (the most literal translation is "You/One/They...[e.g. say, are, do]").</p>
          <p>Verbs can be conjugated either synthetically (with the personal pronoun included in the verb inflection) or analytically (with the verb inflected for tense only and a separate subject). However, the official standard generally prescribes the analytic form in most person-tense combinations, and the synthetic in only some cases, such as the first person plural. The analytic forms are also generally preferred in the western and northern dialects, except in answer to what would in English be "yes/no" questions, while Munster Irish prefers the synthetic forms. For example, the following are the standard form, synthetic form and analytical form of the past tense of <em>rith</em> "to run":</p>

          <header>Pronouns</header>
          <h2>Personal pronouns</h2>
          <p>Personal pronouns in Irish do not inflect for case, but there are three different sets of pronouns used: conjunctive forms, disjunctive forms, and emphatic forms (which may be used either conjunctively or disjunctively)</p>
          <h2>Conjunctive forms</h2>
          <p>The normal word order in Irish is verb-subject-object (VSO). The forms of the subject pronoun directly following the verb are called conjunctive.</p>
          <p>The form muid in the 1st person plural has only recently been approved for use in the official standard, but is very common in western and northern dialects. The standard and southern dialects have no subject pronoun in the 1st person plural, using the synthetic verb ending -imíd (alternatively -imid) instead.</p>
          <p>Irish has no T-V distinction, i.e. it does not differentiate between formal and familiar forms of second person pronouns. The difference between tú and sibh is purely one of number.</p>
          <p>There is no equivalent to the English "it". Either sé or sí are used depending on whether the thing the speaker is referring to is a masculine noun or a feminine noun. The exception is the pronoun ea, used in impersonal copula phrases, particularly in the phrases is ea (&gt; sea) "yes", "so", "that is so", ní hea (the opposite of is ea), nach ea? "is that not so?", an ea (Kerry am b'ea) "Is that so?", fear is ea é "it's a man", and so on.</p>
          <h2>Disjunctive forms</h2>
          <p>If a pronoun is not the subject or if a subject pronoun does not follow the verb (as in a verbless clause, or as the subject of the copula, where the pronoun stands at the end of the sentence), the so-called disjunctive forms are used:</p>

          <p>In Munster dialects the form <em>thú</em> is either (a) archaic (replaced by <em>tú</em>) or (b) is only found after words ending in a vowel.</p>
          <h3>Standard</h3>
          <em>Buailim thú ("I hit you", present tense), Bhuail mé thú ("I hit you", past tense)</em>
          <h3>Dialect type (a)</h3>
          <em>Buailim tú, Bhuail mé tú</em>
          <h3>Dialect type (b)</h3>
          <em>Buailim tú, Bhuail mé thú</em>
          <h3>Intensive forms</h3>
          <p>Irish also has intensive pronouns, used to give the pronouns a bit more weight or emphasis.</p>
          <p>The word <em>féin</em> (/he:nʲ/ or /fʲe:nʲ/) "-self" can follow a pronoun, either to add emphasis or to form a reflexive pronoun:</p>
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>Rinne mé féin é. "I did it myself."</li>
              <li>Ar ghortaigh tú thú féin? "Did you hurt yourself?"</li>
              <li>Sinn Féin is thus "We Ourselves"</li>
            </ul>
